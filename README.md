# OpenClaw Ubuntu Sandbox

A hardened, secure Ubuntu desktop sandbox designed for running **OpenClaw** and **OpenCode AI** with full browser automation capabilities (Playwright/Chromium).

Designed for developers and automation engineers who need a safe, isolated environment that supports code development and complex browser tasks (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord) without compromising host security.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install on your VPS
Run this command on your Ubuntu server:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerwinluk2/openclaw-ubuntu-sandbox/main/install.sh)
```
*(This installs to `~/openclaw-sandbox` and starts the container)*

### 2. Connect from your Local Computer
The sandbox is locked down for security and blocks external connections by default. To access the desktop, run this secure tunnel command in a terminal on your **local computer**:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 root@<YOUR_VPS_IP>
```

### 3. Open the Desktop
Open your browser and visit: **http://localhost:8080**

## ✨ Features

-   **🖥️ Web-based Desktop**: Full XFCE desktop environment accessible via browser (noVNC).
-   **🤖 AI Native**: Pre-configured for **OpenClaw** and **OpenCode AI** with optimized browser drivers.
-   **🔒 Hardened Security**:
    -   **Localhost Only**: No exposed ports to the internet. Access requires SSH tunneling.
    -   **Read-Only Root**: Prevents malware persistence and unauthorized system changes.
    -   **Non-Root User**: Runs as isolated `sandbox` user (UID 1000).
-   **🌐 Browser Automation**: Tuned Chromium with `playwright-extra`, shared memory tweaks, and stealth plugins.
-   **💾 Persistent Workspace**: Your code, sessions, and configs survive restarts (`~/openclaw-sandbox/data`).
-   **⚡ Developer Ready**: Includes Node.js 22, PHP, Composer, and git.

## 🛠️ Manual Installation

If you prefer to run it manually without the helper scripts:

```bash
# Clone into 'openclaw-sandbox' to match the automated installer
git clone https://github.com/kerwinluk2/openclaw-ubuntu-sandbox.git ~/openclaw-sandbox
cd ~/openclaw-sandbox/docker

# Build the image
docker compose build

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

## 🔌 Access & Ports

Services are bound to **127.0.0.1** for security.

| Port | Service | URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8080** | noVNC | `http://localhost:8080` | Web-based Desktop Access |
| **3000** | AIClient | `http://localhost:3000` | AI Client Gateway / UI |

## 🛡️ Security Note

This sandbox balances strict security with usability. While it drops all capabilities and runs read-only, it enables specific features (like shared memory and specific writable volumes) to allow modern browsers and development tools to function correctly. See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for full details.
